I am Umar, a FinTech student at the National University of Singapore.

I strive to build impactful scalable AI Solutions for financial usecases. The intersection between technology and finance has always been a constant source of fascination for me, shaping both my academic and professional aspirations.

Previously, I was a machine learning engineer at the Development Bank of Singapore([DBS](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page)) building conversational AI tools to power banking service. In my professional experience as part of the Conversational AI team, I played a pivotal role along with my team in pioneering the adoption of large language models (LLMs) and RAG systems for production use cases at the bank. I was also involved in the development of a knowledge and vector databases with semantic search capabilities for expedited document analysis and information retrievals and which we used to revamp our existing chatbots. 

\\
I also delivered data science and machine learning projects with [DNV](https://www.dnv.sg/) where i worked on fuel efficiency modelling.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering. Since August 2024, Iâ€™m also pursuing an M.S. in Digital Financial Technology at NUS.
